Learning python

## NOTE
1. input() function always take string by default
2. we need to convert it as our requirement
3. to the values from the key in dictionary , we should use .get() function because it doesnot return error , it return "none"
4. we cannot use dict and list in the set because they are mutable and set is immuatable
